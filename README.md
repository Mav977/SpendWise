# 💸 Spendwise – Smarter, Seamless Expense Tracking

Spendwise is not just another expense tracker — it's a **smarter, AI-powered UPI-aware expense manager** that works *quietly in the background*. You don’t even need to open the app every day — it automatically detects and logs your UPI transactions, and only notifies you when it needs your input. Designed for a seamless and minimal-effort experience.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

Last semester, I found myself forgetting to track expenses — especially UPI payments. I needed an app that *just worked*, without constant manual inputs. So this break, I decided to build **Spendwise** — a personal project that automates my spending logs and gives me useful analytics.

I’ll be using it in college next semester — and maybe you’ll find it useful too!
